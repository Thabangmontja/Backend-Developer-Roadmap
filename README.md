# Backend Developer Roadmap

This repository contains my journey following the [roadmap.sh backend developer path](https://roadmap.sh/). It's a structured guide to help me (and others) develop the essential skills for backend development. 

## Project Structure

- **beginner**: Contains introductory projects and scripts to build foundational skills.
  - `task_tracker.py`: A command-line application for managing tasks, where you can add, update, and mark tasks as completed.

## Features of Task Tracker
- Add, update, and delete tasks
- Mark tasks as in progress or done
- List tasks based on their status (todo, in-progress, done)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Thabangmontja/Backend-Developer-Roadmap.git
   cd Backend-Developer-Roadmap
